# Public Crypto Market

The Public Crypto Market is an optional layer providing transparency and
automation using blockchain technology, while avoiding speculative behavior.

## Core concepts

- **Invention Utility Tokens (IUTs)**
  - Represent access and utility (e.g., right to use an invention dataset).
  - Not designed as speculative assets.

- **Royalty Smart Contracts**
  - Encode license terms and royalty rates.
  - Automate routing of payments when usage data or funds are received.
  - Provide on-chain transparency for involved parties.

- **Public Ledger Anchoring**
  - Hashes of invention records and key state transitions are anchored
    to a public blockchain to prove provenance and detect tampering.

## Anti-speculation guardrails

- Protocol-level rules that:
  - Disallow leverage.
  - Discourage wash trading and bot-driven speculation.
  - Tie token utilities to concrete, verifiable platform usage.

## Integration with the JARVONDIS Reserve

- On-chain transactions involving:
  - License fees.
  - Certain token-based usage payments.

Include a protocol fee where 2% of gross volume is automatically directed
to a reserve address associated with the JARVONDIS Reserve.

This ensures that on-chain economic activity supports long-term stability
in the same way as off-chain markets.
