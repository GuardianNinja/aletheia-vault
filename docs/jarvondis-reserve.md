# JARVONDIS Reserve

The JARVONDIS Reserve is a stabilization mechanism and contingency fund
managed on the JARVONDIS University platform.

Its purpose is to keep Aletheia Vault economically resilient and protect
inventors from severe payout volatility.

## Core rule

- Each week, 2% of **gross transaction volume** from:
  - The Investor Market,
  - The Franchise Market, and
  - The Public Crypto Market,

is automatically routed into the JARVONDIS Reserve account.

## Uses of the reserve

Priority order:

1. **Stabilization of Inventor Payouts**
   - Cover shortfalls when expected royalties would otherwise dip below
     agreed or stable ranges due to temporary downturns or delays.

2. **Continuity of Critical Operations**
   - Fund core infrastructure, security, and governance functions during
     revenue dips to prevent platform degradation.

3. **Strategic Grants (Optional, Only Above Threshold)**
   - When the reserve exceeds a defined safety buffer (e.g., 12–18 months
     of projected payouts and operating costs), surplus may be allocated
     to grants or scholarships aligned with JARVONDIS University’s mission.

## Governance

- **Multi-Authority Approval**
  - Reserve withdrawals require approvals from:
    - Designated governance council members.
    - JARVONDIS University stewardship.
    - Automated checks to prevent crossing safety thresholds.

- **Safety Floors and Targets**
  - A minimum reserve level (floor) is defined.
  - A target range is set (e.g., 1.5–2 years of buffer).
  - Policies define when and how to rebalance.

- **Transparency**
  - Public dashboards showing:
    - Reserve size over time.
    - Weekly inflows from each market.
    - Outflows by category (payout stabilization, operations, grants).

## Behavior over time

Conceptual sandbox simulations (see `sandbox-hardening-report.md`) suggest:

- Year 1–2: Reserve grows slowly, mainly as a buffer-in-formation.
- Year 3: Reserve becomes meaningfully protective as markets scale.
- Year 4: In a major downturn, the reserve can smooth payouts and maintain
  core services, then rebuild afterward.
- Year 5: System emerges with a track record of resilience and trust.

The reserve is thus a structural expression of stewardship and long-term care.
