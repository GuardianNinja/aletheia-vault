## Integration with the JARVONDIS Reserve

- Weekly, 2% of **gross franchise-related flows** (upfront fees and ongoing
  royalties) is transferred into the JARVONDIS Reserve.

- This supports:
  - Long-term platform stability.
  - Consistent payout streams during local or sector-specific downturns.
