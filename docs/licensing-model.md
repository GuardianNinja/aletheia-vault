# Licensing model

This document describes how licensing works in Aletheia Vault and how it is
designed to support long-term community growth and fair compensation.

---

## Goals of the licensing model

- Ensure inventors retain meaningful control over how their work is used.
- Make it easy for organizations to license inventions transparently.
- Encourage collaborative improvement and open learning.
- Provide clear financial structures that can sustain creators and the platform.
- Keep the system accessible and community-oriented, not extractive.

## License families

Aletheia Vault provides several standard license families. These can be
adapted or extended as needed, but having defaults keeps things predictable
and fair.

### 1. Exploration License

**Use case:**

- Learning, teaching, non-commercial exploration.

**Key terms:**

- Non-commercial use only.
- Attribution required (inventor and Aletheia Vault).
- No sublicensing or resale.
- Modifications must clearly identify original authorship and changes.

### 2. Community Collaboration License

**Use case:**

- Open research, prototypes, and non-commercial projects.
- Community labs, schools, and open-source experiments.

**Key terms:**

- Non-commercial use permitted.
- Attribution required.
- Improvements and derivatives:
  - Encouraged to be shared back into the Vault where possible.
- Option to negotiate a commercial upgrade license later.

### 3. Revenue-Share Commercial License

**Use case:**

- Companies and organizations building commercial products or services
  based on an invention.

**Key terms:**

- Clearly defined scope:
  - Fields of use.
  - Territory.
  - Duration.
- Royalty-based:
  - Percentage of revenue or profit (e.g., 5–15%).
  - Or per-unit basis.
- Payout frequency:
  - Typically monthly or quarterly.
- Transparency:
  - Usage and revenue reporting required.
- Non-exclusive by default, unless negotiated otherwise.

### 4. Franchise License

**Use case:**

- Regional or sector-specific rights.
- Educational franchises, manufacturing partners, local operators.

**Key terms:**

- Territory-based or sector-based exclusivity options.
- Multi-tier royalty structure:
  - Base inventor share.
  - Franchisee share.
  - Platform fee.
- Performance requirements (minimum activity, quality standards).
- Standard dispute and termination clauses.

### 5. Flat-Fee / Buyout License

**Use case:**

- One-time acquisition of defined rights where recurring royalties are
  not desired or practical.

**Key terms:**

- Carefully defined scope and limits:
  - Fields of use and territory.
  - Whether rights are exclusive or non-exclusive.
- No ongoing royalties unless explicitly included.
- Strongly recommended for inventors to consider revenue-share first,
  then buyout only when it serves their long-term interests.

## License workflow

1. **Inventor sets preferences**
   - Chooses default license family (e.g., exploration + revenue-share).
   - Can indicate minimum acceptable royalty ranges or conditions.

2. **Licensee initiates request**
   - Selects an invention and clicks "Request License."
   - Chooses license type and describes intended use.

3. **AI-assisted term building**
   - The system suggests terms based on:
     - Industry norms.
     - Inventor preferences.
     - Community fairness principles.
   - Clearly labeled as assistance, not legal advice.

4. **Negotiation**
   - Parties can adjust:
     - Rates.
     - Scope.
     - Duration.
     - Reporting obligations.
   - All proposals and changes are tracked.

5. **Agreement and record**
   - Both parties accept final terms.
   - A license artifact is stored in the Vault.
   - Optionally mirrored in a smart contract for automation.

## Community protections

- Standard licenses are designed to:
  - Keep innovation accessible where possible.
  - Encourage non-commercial sharing and learning.
  - Preserve options for inventors to benefit from commercial uses.
- The platform’s own fees are transparent and limited.
- The **JARVONDIS Reserve** receives 2% of gross flows from:
  - Investor Market.
  - Franchise Market.
  - Public Crypto Market.
- This reserve is used to:
  - Stabilize payouts.
  - Support critical operations.
  - Provide a long-term safety net for the community.

## Legal guidance

Aletheia Vault does not replace legal counsel.

- Licenses are structured to be understandable and fair.
- Users are encouraged to:
  - Seek legal advice for high-stakes agreements.
  - Consult local IP laws and regulations.

The licensing model is intentionally open and documented so that communities
can understand how value flows and how the system aims to sustain creators
over the long term.
